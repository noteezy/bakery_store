# Online Bakery Store
My online Bakery Store (project for university)
My aim for this project is to write website with pretty (I hope so) frontend and working backend.

UPD: For now I've done with this project.
Libs I used:
- express (_core framework_)
- path (_path for directory with static files_)
- jwt (_for logging and keeping user logged_)
- cookieParser (_also for logging, I keep jwt token in cookies_)
- bcrypt (_hashing passwords in database, just little security in project c:_)
- nodemailer (_for sending emails, also used Mailtrap.io_)
- pg Pool (_for connection with database and queries_)
